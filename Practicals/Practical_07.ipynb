    "# Practical 7: Maximum likelihood\n",
    "In this practical you will learn how to find a maximum likelihood estimate (MLE). As we saw in the lecture, if the problem is linear and the errors are Gaussian, then the MLE is the BLUE. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the BLUE is the best (i.e. lowest variance) **linear** estimator, it might be that there is a better **non linear** estimator. \n",
    "The aim here is to find a MLE for a simple problem that is nonlinear, and actually performs better than the BLUE. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, you will simulate measurements for a given set of model parameters and then use both the BLUE and the MLE to invert the problem 100 times. Simulation of data has the advantage that you know what the true values are for the model parameters, which enables you to assess how successful each estimator is.\n",
