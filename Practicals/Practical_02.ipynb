    "At the geophones (the seismometers that measure the waves) closest to the source, the first arrivals are the direct waves that travel along the surface. In the middle distance, the first arrivals are the refracted waves that travel along the top of the middle layer, because the waves can travel through the middle layer (even with the descent and ascent of the wave) in less time than the direct surface wave takes. For a similar reason, at the farthest geophones, the first arrivals are refracted and travel along the top of the deepest layer (which has the fastest seismic velocity). A plot of first arrivals looks like Figure 2.\n",
